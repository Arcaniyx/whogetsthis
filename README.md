# WhoGetsThis? - Genshin Impact & Honkai Star Rail Artefact Analyzer

**WhoGetsThis?** is an interactive website that allows players of **Genshin Impact** and **Honkai Star Rail** to determine which characters are best suited to equip a given artefact. The site analyzes the artefact's stats and provides a list of characters ranked by relevance for the equipment.

## Features

- **Game Selection**: 
  - Users can choose between **Genshin Impact** or **Honkai Star Rail** to tailor the artefact analysis for each game. This ensures that the character recommendations are specific to the game you're playing and take into account game-specific mechanics and characters.
  
- **Artefact Analysis**: 
  - Users input key information about their artefact: 
    - **Set**: Choose the set of the artefact (e.g., Gladiator's Finale, Wanderer's Troupe, etc.).
    - **Main Stat**: Enter the main stat (e.g., ATK%, DEF%, Crit Rate, etc.) that the artefact boosts.
    - **Sub-stats**: Add the sub-stats (if applicable) that the artefact includes.
  - This data allows the site to compute the best-suited characters for the artefact based on their synergies and stat requirements.

- **Character Recommendations**: 
  - Once the artefact data is entered, the site generates a list of recommended characters who would benefit the most from the selected artefact, based on their roles, elemental affinities, and abilities.
  - The list is **sorted by relevance**, prioritizing characters who maximize the potential of the artefact. This takes into account various factors such as elemental resonance, playstyle, and synergy with the set bonuses.

- **Genshin Impact-inspired Interface**:
  - The interface design is inspired by the look and feel of **Genshin Impact**, providing an intuitive and familiar experience for users who are accustomed to the game. The layout is clean and user-friendly, with a focus on making the artefact input process as easy and seamless as possible.
